--[ 1 - What is this

    PORKCHOP CYD is a WiFi security research tool ported from the original
    M5PORKCHOP project (M5Stack Cardputer) to the ESP32-2432S028R "Cheap
    Yellow Display" — a $15 ESP32 board with a 2.8" ILI9341 TFT, resistive
    touchscreen, SD card slot, speaker amp, and UART connector.

    It does 802.11 passive scanning, deauth, handshake capture, PMKID
    harvesting, wardriving with GPS, fake beacon injection, RF spectrum
    analysis, Flock Safety ALPR camera detection, Axon bodycam detection,
    WiGLE/WPA-SEC upload, and more.

    Everything runs in a single .ino file. Flash and go.

    This is a research and educational tool. Use it only on networks and in
    areas where you have explicit permission. Laws regarding WiFi monitoring,
    packet injection, and surveillance detection vary by jurisdiction.

       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

    2. Tools → Board → Boards Manager → search "esp32" → install Espressif

    3. Select: ESP32 Dev Module

    Board settings:

        Board:              ESP32 Dev Module
        Upload Speed:       921600
        CPU Frequency:      240MHz
        Flash Frequency:    80MHz
        Flash Mode:         DIO
        Flash Size:         4MB (32Mb)
        Partition Scheme:   Default 4MB with spiffs
        PSRAM:              Disabled


----[ 5.3 - Library Dependencies

    Install via Library Manager (Tools → Manage Libraries):

        TFT_eSPI                by Bodmer
        XPT2046_Touchscreen     by Paul Stoffregen
        TinyGPS++               by Mikal Hart  (for GPS wardriving)

    Copy User_Setup.h into your TFT_eSPI library folder, replacing the
    existing one. This sets the correct pin config for the CYD variant.

    The following are included in the ESP32 Arduino Core (no install):

        WiFi, WiFiClientSecure, SD, SPI, Preferences, SPIFFS,
        esp_wifi, lwip/sockets, mbedtls/base64


----[ 5.4 - API Keys

    Open PorkChop_CYD.ino and search for:

        PASTE YOUR API KEYS HERE

    You will find three lines around line 196:

        char wigleApiName[48]  = "";   // paste WiGLE account name here
        char wigleApiToken[48] = "";   // paste WiGLE API token here
        char wpasecKey[48]     = "";   // paste WPA-SEC key here

    Paste your keys between the quotes, save, and flash.
    Keys survive reflash (stored in NVS).

    To get your keys:

        WiGLE:   wigle.net → Account → API → show token

        R       GPIO 4
        G       GPIO 16
        B       GPIO 17

    UART Connector (back of board):

        5V  |  GND  |  TXD  |  RXD
        ↑ power GPS here    ↑ GPS TX wire goes here

    CN1 Connector (back of board):

        3.3V  |  GPIO 27  |  GPIO 22  |  GND

    CRITICAL: GPIO 26 = speaker only. Never reassign.
    CRITICAL: GPIO 25 = touch CLK. Never drive as output.
    CRITICAL: SD CS = GPIO 5 only.


--[ 7 - SD Card Setup

    Format card as FAT32 before first use.

    Create these folders on the card:

        /captures/    ← handshake .22000 files saved here
        /wigle/       ← wardriving .csv files saved here

    The firmware creates these directories automatically if they don't
    exist, but creating them manually avoids the first-save delay.

    Files are named automatically:

        /captures/SSID_BSSID.22000      hashcat WPA format
        /captures/SSID_BSSID.16800      PMKID-only format
        /wigle/wardrive_XXXXXX.csv      WiGLE wardriving CSV


--[ 8 - Modes


----[ 8.1 - IDLE / Home

    The pig lives here. Mood shifts with network activity.
    Status bar shows mode, heap, scan count, XP level.

    Tap:  open menu
    Hold: cycle theme


----[ 8.2 - OINK MODE

    Active deauth + EAPOL handshake capture + PMKID harvest.

    Scans for WPA2 targets, sends deauth frames to disconnect clients,
    captures 4-way handshake when they reconnect. Also captures PMKID
    from EAPOL M1 without requiring a client to be present.

    Captures save automatically to /captures/ on SD card.

    Note: promiscuous filter set to DATA-only during OINK to prevent
    WiFi driver watchdog timeouts in dense RF environments.

    Bottom bar tap: exit
    Hold: stop + back to IDLE


----[ 8.3 - DO NO HAM

    Passive monitoring only. Zero transmission.

    Sniffs 802.11 management and data frames. Tracks networks,
    clients, handshakes, PMKIDs. No deauth, no injection.

    Bottom bar tap: exit
    Hold: back to IDLE


----[ 8.4 - SGT WARHOG

    Wardriving mode with GPS coordinate logging.

    Scans and logs all visible networks with RSSI, encryption,
    channel, BSSID, and GPS coordinates (if fix available).
    Saves WiGLE-compatible CSV to /wigle/ on exit.

    GPS fix shown in status bar as GPS:FIX or satellite count.
    With GPS fix, each network entry gets real lat/lon/altitude.
    Without fix, coordinates are 0.000000.

    Bottom bar tap: exit + save CSV
    Hold: save + back to IDLE


----[ 8.5 - SPECTRUM

    Fake beacon injection.

    Broadcasts 802.11 beacon frames with spoofed SSIDs fingerprinted
    from nearby access points. Tap bottom zones to cycle beacon rate.

    Bottom bar tap: exit
    Hold: stop + back to IDLE


----[ 8.7 - PIGGY BLUES

    BLE advertisement spam — stubbed on CYD.

    The BLE stack requires ~60KB contiguous RAM which cannot coexist
    with the display sprite and WiFi stack on the CYD's 320KB heap.
    Mode displays a message explaining the constraint.

    Hardware limitation. Cannot be resolved without reducing other
    features.


----[ 8.8 - PORK PATROL

    Surveillance camera detection. The pig goes undercover.

    Passively scans the WiFi network list for known signatures of:

        [CAM] Flock Safety ALPR cameras
              — 20 known OUI prefixes from deflock.me dataset
              — SSID patterns: flock, fs ext, pigvision, penguin,
                flockca

        [BWC] Axon / Motorola body-worn cameras
              — Axon OUI 00:25:DF (confirmed bodycam prefix)
              — SSID patterns: axon, bwcviewer, evidence, taser,
                motorola bwc, vievu, v300, v500, ibr

    Display shows FLOCK:X BODYCAM:Y TOTAL:Z when devices spotted.
    Each detection triggers an alert sound and logs to serial with
    GPS coordinates if a fix is available.

    Detection uses existing passive scan data — zero extra transmission.
    Works alongside any other mode that keeps NetworkRecon running.

    Detection signatures sourced from deflock.me, flock-you
    (colonelpanichacks), and WiGLE OUI research (vertex.link).

--[ 10 - GPS

    Module: ATGM336H (NMEA 0183, 9600 baud)
    Connection: CYD UART connector (back of board)

    Wiring:

        ATGM336H 3V3  →  UART connector 5V  (module accepts 3.3-5V)
        ATGM336H GND  →  UART connector GND
        ATGM336H TX   →  UART connector RXD
        ATGM336H RX   →  not connected

    GPS feeds real coordinates into WiGLE CSV during wardriving and
    PORK PATROL detection logs.

    Status bar in WARHOG shows GPS:FIX when locked or satellite count
    while searching. Cold fix typically takes 30-90 seconds outdoors.

    Note: A few garbage characters may appear at boot in Serial Monitor
    due to GPIO 3 being shared between GPS NMEA output and UART0.
    This is cosmetic only and does not affect operation.


--[ 11 - SD Card Saves

    Handshakes (.22000 format, hashcat compatible):

        /captures/SSID_BSSID.22000

    PMKID-only captures (.16800 format):

        /captures/SSID_BSSID.16800

    WiGLE wardriving CSV:

        /wigle/wardrive_XXXXXX.csv

    Files save automatically:
        Handshakes/PMKIDs: immediately on capture in OINK/DNH mode
        WiGLE CSV: on exit from WARHOG mode

    SD card must be FAT32. Folders /captures and /wigle must exist
    at the root of the card (created automatically on first save
    if missing).


--[ 12 - WiGLE Upload

    Uploads wardriving CSV files to api.wigle.net.

    Setup: paste WiGLE API name and token in source (section 5.4)
    or enter via Serial Monitor in SETTINGS.

    To upload:
        CAPTURES screen → tap WIGLE button (bottom-right)
        All CSV files in /wigle/ are uploaded via HTTPS POST

    Requires WiFi connection. Button shows green when configured.


--[ 13 - WPA-SEC Upload

    Uploads captured handshakes to wpa-sec.stanev.org for
    distributed cracking against 10+ billion passwords.

    Setup: paste WPA-SEC API key in source (section 5.4)
    or enter via Serial Monitor in SETTINGS.

    To upload:
        CAPTURES screen → tap WPASEC button (bottom-left)
        All .22000 files in /captures/ are uploaded via HTTPS POST

    Button shows green when API key is configured.


--[ 14 - Speaker & Sound

    Amp: NS4168 class-D on GPIO 26, AC-coupled input.
    Signal: ledc PWM at 50% duty (true square wave) on 10-bit timer.

    For louder output, wire a PAM8403 amplifier module between
    GPIO 26 and your speaker. Search "PAM8403 audio amplifier module"
    on Amazon (~$2). Gives 3W vs the built-in 0.5W.

    PAM8403 wiring:

        CYD GPIO 26  →  PAM8403 Left IN+
        CYD GND      →  PAM8403 Left IN-
        CYD 3.3V     →  PAM8403 VCC
        CYD GND      →  PAM8403 GND
        PAM8403 OUT+ →  Speaker +
        PAM8403 OUT- →  Speaker -

    25 sound events: BOOT, CLICK, HANDSHAKE, PMKID, DEAUTH,
    ACHIEVEMENT, LEVEL_UP, CHALLENGE_COMPLETE, UPLOAD_OK, and more.

    Sound toggle: SETTINGS → bottom half tap (ON/OFF).
    Volume is always maximum (50% duty = loudest square wave through
    the AC coupling cap).


--[ 15 - XP & Leveling

    XP accumulates across all activity. Level is permanent (NVS).

    Key XP events:

        Network scan          +1 XP per unique network
        Handshake capture     +50 XP
        PMKID capture         +30 XP
        Deauth sent           +2 XP
        Challenge complete    +15 to +300 XP (by difficulty)
        Achievement unlock    +100 XP
        WiGLE upload          +25 XP
        WPA-SEC upload        +25 XP

    Current level and total XP shown in status bar and SWINE STATS.


--[ 16 - Challenges

    Three challenges active at all times (EASY / MEDIUM / HARD).
    Regenerate each boot with randomized targets and XP rewards.

    Challenge types include: scan N nets, capture N handshakes,
    capture N PMKIDs, send N deauths, find N open/hidden/WPA3 nets,
    lurk silently, and more.

    Completing all three in one session triggers CHALLENGE_SWEEP bonus.
    Progress tracked automatically across all modes.


--[ 17 - Achievements

    46 achievements unlock automatically during use.
    Stored in NVS — survive reflashing.

    Categories: network discovery, capture milestones, deauth
    milestones, wardriving, XP milestones, social/upload,
    and hidden triggers.

    Earning an achievement plays a fanfare and displays the name
    as a toast. The pig does a happy bounce.


--[ 18 - Change Log

    CYD port created by xom — changes from original M5PORKCHOP:

    Hardware:
        Ported from M5Stack Cardputer to ESP32-2432S028R
        ILI9341 TFT via HSPI (MOSI=13 MISO=12 CLK=14 CS=15 DC=2)
        XPT2046 touch via VSPI (CLK=25 MISO=39 MOSI=32 CS=33 IRQ=36)
        NS4168 speaker amp via GPIO 26 (ledc PWM, no tone())
        ATGM336H GPS via UART connector (GPIO 3 RX, 9600 baud)
        SD card via VSPI default (CLK=18 MISO=19 MOSI=23 CS=5)

    Navigation:
        Zone-based touch navigation (no keyboard)
        Top/mid/bottom tap zones for menu scroll/select
        Top-left corner = back on all screens
        Bottom bar [X] button = exit any mode

    New features:
        PORK PATROL — Flock Safety ALPR + Axon bodycam detection
            20 Flock OUI prefixes + 5 SSID patterns (deflock.me)
            3 Axon OUI prefixes + 9 SSID patterns (bodycam WiFi)
            GPS-tagged serial log on detection
            Passive — runs on existing scan data, zero extra TX
        WiGLE HTTPS upload directly from CAPTURES screen
        WPA-SEC HTTPS upload directly from CAPTURES screen
        Web Remote (HTTP AP server, browser screen mirror)
        GPS coordinate logging in WiGLE wardriving CSV
        GPS coordinate logging in PORK PATROL detections
        ledc-based SFX system (25 sounds, no tone() crashes)
        ISR-safe promiscuous mode (DATA-only filter during OINK)
        API keys configurable in source before flashing

    Bug fixes:
        tone() crash on ESP32 core 3.x → replaced with ledc
        WDT crash in OINK → beacon callbacks filtered at driver level
        WiFi driver deadlock → volatile callback pointer, no mutex
        Stack canary in WebUI → increased task stack
        SD directory creation → parent dirs created automatically
        NimBLE/sprite memory conflict → BLE stubbed, sprite preserved

    Known limitations:
        PIGGY BLUES unavailable — BLE stack (~60KB) + sprite (102KB)
          + WiFi + SD exceeds 320KB heap. Hardware constraint.
        Web Remote screen mirror occasionally stalls (Chrome issue)
        GPS NMEA causes brief garbage at boot (GPIO 3 shared)
        SPIFFS mount error at boot is cosmetic (formats on first use)
